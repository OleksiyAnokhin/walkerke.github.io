I'm Kyle Walker, an assistant professor in the [Department of History & Geography](http://www.his.tcu.edu) at [Texas Christian University](http://www.tcu.edu).  One of my favorite things about university teaching is developing new pedagogical tools.  I'm fascinated by the recent developments that have taken place in interactive data visualization, and this site details my experiences using these new frameworks to teach concepts in human geography.  I hope this site serves as a resource for other educators who might be interested in using these frameworks in their own classrooms; as such, many of my examples are built with open-source tools, use open data, and are available as GitHub repos.  

I am always interested in learning new tools, but I do have a few favorites: [Python with the IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), [R with RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), [ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/features/), [QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/), and [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/)/[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/).  If you want to learn more about my work at TCU, please visit my professional website [here](http://kylewalkertcu.wordpress.com).  I write all of my posts for this site in Markdown, and generate the blog with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/).
