I'm Kyle Walker, an assistant professor in the [Department of History & Geography](http://www.his.tcu.edu) at [Texas Christian University](http://www.tcu.edu).  One of my favorite things about teaching is the opportunities it grants me to develop pedagogical tools using cutting-edge technological innovations.  I'm fascinated by the recent developments that have taken place in interactive data visualization, and this site details my experiences using these new frameworks to teach concepts in human geography.  I hope this site serves as a resource for other educators who might be interested in using these frameworks in their own classrooms; as such, many of my examples are built with open-source tools, use open data, and are available as GitHub repos.  

I am always interested in learning new tools, but I do have a few favorites: Python, R with RStudio, ArcGIS, QGIS, and TileMill/MapBox.  If you want to learn more about my work at TCU, please visit my professional website [here](http://kylewalkertcu.wordpress.com).
