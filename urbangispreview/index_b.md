## What is Urban & Business GIS?

In this course, you will build upon the skills you learned in Intro to GIS and gain experience with several more advanced 
applications of GIS software.  In particular, you'll learn how to use GIS to solve real-world problems in urban and business analysis.  You'll accomplish this through regular lab assignments, a simulated business GIS assignment, and a group 
project in which you will use GIS to assist an actual client in the Fort Worth community.
