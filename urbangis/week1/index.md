## Mini-GIS review

### Discuss:

* What types of GIS data might we use in an urban or business analysis?
* How can you deploy tabular data in a GIS?  
* What quality checks would you employ to ensure that your data are appropriate for your study design?

## Raster vs. Vector data

* What differentiates the raster data model from the vector data model?  

---

## Raster data source: [The USGS National Map](http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/)

## Quality control checks for GIS data

### Issues to address:

* Are my data in an appropriate projection?  
* Is the resolution of my data appropriate for my project?
* Are my data topologically sound?  Do they need to be for my project?
* Are my data appropriately documented?  Do I know that my data are accurate?
